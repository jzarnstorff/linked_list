## A Simple Linked List Library

This repository uses `gcc` and `make` to build an executable application.

If both `gcc` and `make` are installed on your system, compile the application using the `make` command and run the application using the following command: `./build/linked_list`

If `doxygen` is installed on your system, run `make docs` to build documentation and view it by opening `./html/index.html` using your favorite web browser.
